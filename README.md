### It needs an update!

Usually our [cron](CRON.md) will take care of that within 24 hours.

If you need to trigger an update right now, run `rake api:update`. To check if all specifications have a valid format, run `rake api:validate`. If all looks good, please create a pull request. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Usage

The reference is used by the following client projects to generate API client code.

### Slack

This project is not affiliated with the [company that makes Slack](https://slack.com). We began by forking JSON schema files from [slackhq/slack-api-docs](https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs), then updating the schema from the documentation at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) to, finally, relying on a scraper. Undocumented methods have been added in November 2017 and are maintained manually.
