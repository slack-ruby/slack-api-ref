Clients can use this to update their local list of users' presence. If a user updates their presence manually, the manual_presence_change event will also be sent to all connected clients for that user. There are two forms of this event. When only one user's presence is being communicated, you'll receive a user field with a single user ID present within. This form is deprecated. Pass the batch_presence_aware=true parameter to rtm.start or rtm.connect to instruct the Slack message server to batch your presence messages and send a users attribute instead, containing an array of users changing to the same status. Sometimes you'll get a single event for a single user but if you use batch_presence_aware=true, that single user event will be single item in the users array. In case you missed that: if you send batch_presence_aware=true then the shape of presence_change events changes. Instead of a string-based user field, you'll get users, an array. If you're writing a library that supports presence_change events, you should be prepared to handle both kinds of presence events.",
