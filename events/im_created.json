  "long_desc": "The im_created event is sent to all connections for a user when a new direct message channel is created that they are a member of. This message lets the client know that a channel has been created, but the client should show no changes based on this, just update its internal list of IM channels. Usually this event is followed by an im_open event. When an event occurs, we will send an HTTP POST request to your Request URL. The outer payload is uniform across all Events API methods, and contains fields like team_id and event. Learn more",
